# Stage-Specific Coaching

Guidance for adjusting feedback based on the interview stage being practiced.

## Phone Screen

**Duration:** 30-45 minutes total, 5-7 minutes per question.
**What matters most:** Communication clarity, enthusiasm, conciseness.

**Coaching focus:**
- Keep answers under 2 minutes
- Lead with energy — you're selling yourself as someone they want to spend a full day with
- Focus on high-level impact, not implementation details
- Show genuine interest in the company and role
- Have 2-3 crisp stories ready that cover your range

**Common mistakes at this stage:**
- Going too deep into technical details
- Rambling past the time budget
- Not asking questions about the role/company
- Treating it as a technical screen when it's a culture screen

## Technical Round

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes, mix of coding and discussion.
**What matters most:** Problem-solving approach, technical communication, code quality.

**Coaching focus:**
- Think aloud — silence is your enemy in a technical round
- Ask clarifying questions before diving in
- Discuss tradeoffs explicitly ("I'm choosing X over Y because...")
- Write clean, readable code — not clever code
- Test your solution with edge cases

**Common mistakes at this stage:**
- Starting to code before understanding the problem
- Optimizing prematurely
- Not communicating your thought process
- Giving up instead of asking for hints
- Ignoring edge cases

## Onsite (Behavioral Rounds)

**Duration:** 45 minutes per round, 4-6 rounds total.
**What matters most:** Depth, specificity, pattern of leadership and impact.

**Coaching focus:**
- You'll tell 8-12 stories across the day — prepare varied examples
- STAR format is your friend but don't be robotic about it
- Tailor stories to the interviewer's role and concerns
- Show a pattern of increasing scope and impact
- Be ready for follow-ups that go 2-3 levels deep

**Common mistakes at this stage:**
- Using the same example for every question
- Answers that don't match the level you're interviewing for
- Not reading the interviewer's cues (they may want you to go deeper or move on)
- Fatigue-driven rambling in later rounds

## System Design

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes for one problem.
**What matters most:** Structured approach, tradeoff analysis, breadth AND depth.

**Coaching focus:**
- Spend the first 5 minutes on requirements and constraints
- Start with the high-level architecture, then drill into components
- Always discuss tradeoffs — there are no "right" answers, only justified ones
- Address scalability, reliability, and cost
- Be prepared to dive deep into any component you draw

**Common mistakes at this stage:**
- Jumping to a solution without gathering requirements
- Drawing boxes without explaining data flow
- Ignoring non-functional requirements (latency, availability, cost)
- Not driving the conversation — waiting for the interviewer to guide you
- Designing for current scale instead of target scale

## Bar Raiser

**Duration:** 45-60 minutes, typically behavioral with depth.
**What matters most:** Consistency, judgment, genuine self-reflection.

**Coaching focus:**
- This interviewer will ask the same question from multiple angles — be consistent
- They're testing judgment more than knowledge
- Failure stories are critical — have 2-3 genuine ones ready
- Show evidence of raising the bar for others, not just yourself
- Connect everything to customer/user impact

**Common mistakes at this stage:**
- Polished answers that feel rehearsed
- Inconsistency when the same topic comes up from a different angle
- No failure stories, or only trivial ones
- Can't articulate how their work affected customers
- Optimizing for looking good instead of being authentic
