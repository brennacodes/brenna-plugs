# Feedback Rubric

Scoring dimensions for evaluating interview answers. Each dimension is scored 1-5.

## Dimensions

### Specificity (1-5)

How concrete and detailed is the answer?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Entirely abstract. No specific example, no details. |
| 2 | Vague reference to an experience. Missing key details. |
| 3 | References a real situation with some details. Missing specifics like names, numbers, or timeline. |
| 4 | Clear, specific situation with most details. Could add more metrics or stakeholder context. |
| 5 | Rich in detail. Specific people (roles), timeline, metrics, and context. Feels like you were there. |

### Structure (1-5)

Does the answer follow a clear narrative arc?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Stream of consciousness. No discernible structure. |
| 2 | Has a beginning and end but rambles. Hard to follow. |
| 3 | Basic structure visible. Could be tighter. Some tangents. |
| 4 | Clear STAR/CAR format. Logical flow. Minor improvements possible. |
| 5 | Crisp narrative. Sets up context efficiently, describes action clearly, delivers result with impact. No wasted words. |

### Impact (1-5)

Does the answer demonstrate measurable outcomes?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | No outcome described. Ends with "and so we did it." |
| 2 | Vague positive outcome. "It went well." |
| 3 | Describes the outcome but doesn't quantify. "The team was happy." |
| 4 | Quantified outcome with some context. "Reduced latency by 40%." |
| 5 | Quantified outcome with scope, comparison, and lasting impact. "Reduced p99 latency from 800ms to 120ms, saving $50K/month in compute and unblocking the mobile team's launch." |

### Relevance (1-5)

Does the answer actually address the question?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Completely off-topic. Answers a different question. |
| 2 | Tangentially related but misses the core of the question. |
| 3 | Addresses the question but drifts to a different topic partway through. |
| 4 | Solid match to the question. Minor digressions. |
| 5 | Precisely targeted. Every sentence contributes to answering the specific question asked. |

### Self-Advocacy (1-5)

Does the candidate own their contribution appropriately?

| Score | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| 1 | Pure deflection. "The team did it." No individual contribution visible. |
| 2 | Mentions being part of the team but unclear what they specifically did. |
| 3 | Some individual actions described but hedged with "we" throughout. |
| 4 | Clear individual contribution within team context. Good balance. |
| 5 | Confidently owns their role. Credits others where appropriate. Makes their specific impact unmistakable without diminishing teammates. |
