# Answer Anti-Patterns

Common patterns that weaken interview answers. Detect these during analysis and flag them in feedback with specific examples from the user's response.

## Structural Anti-Patterns

### The Rambler
**Signal:** Answer exceeds 3 minutes for a behavioral question or loses the thread midway.
**Coaching:** "Your answer has great content but needs editing. Try leading with the punchline — state the outcome first, then explain how you got there."

### The Setup-Heavy
**Signal:** 60%+ of the answer is context/setup with a rushed action and result.
**Coaching:** "You're giving me a novel when I need a short story. Two sentences of context max, then show me what you did and what happened."

### The Listicle
**Signal:** Answer is a list of things they did with no narrative connecting them.
**Coaching:** "I'm hearing tasks, not a story. Pick the single most impactful thing you did and build a narrative around it."

### The Cliff-Hanger
**Signal:** Great setup and action but no clear result or outcome stated.
**Coaching:** "You've got me hooked but I don't know how it ends. Always close with the measurable result — what changed because of what you did?"

## Content Anti-Patterns

### The Team Hider
**Signal:** Uses "we" exclusively, even when asked about their specific contribution.
**Coaching:** "I can tell this was a team effort, but I need to understand YOUR role. What specifically did YOU do? It's not bragging — it's answering the question."

### The Credit Absorber
**Signal:** Uses "I" exclusively for what was clearly a team effort. No acknowledgment of others.
**Coaching:** "This sounds like a big effort. Who else was involved, and what was your unique contribution versus the team's?"

### The Humble Deflector
**Signal:** Minimizes their contribution. "It wasn't a big deal" or "anyone could have done it."
**Coaching:** "Stop underselling yourself. If you did the work and it had impact, own it. That's not arrogance — that's accuracy."

### The Blame Narrator
**Signal:** Every challenge or failure is someone else's fault. External factors caused all problems.
**Coaching:** "I'm hearing about what went wrong around you, but not about your agency in the situation. What was in your control, and what did you do with it?"

### The Hypothetical Answerer
**Signal:** Answers a "tell me about a time" question with "I would..." instead of "I did..."
**Coaching:** "I need a real example, not what you would do. Think of a specific time this actually happened, even if it's small."

## Delivery Anti-Patterns

### The Apologizer
**Signal:** Prefaces answers with self-deprecation. "This isn't a great example, but..."
**Coaching:** "Never apologize for your answer before giving it. If it's the example you chose, own it. You can always caveat after."

### The Over-Qualifier
**Signal:** Hedges every statement. "I think... maybe... sort of... it was probably..."
**Coaching:** "You sound uncertain about your own experience. State what happened directly. You were there — be confident about what you observed."

### The Perfectionist
**Signal:** Only tells stories where everything went perfectly. No failures, no challenges, no learning.
**Coaching:** "This sounds too clean. Interviewers want to see how you handle messy reality. What was the hardest part? What almost went wrong?"

## Detection Instructions

When analyzing a user's answer:
1. Check for each anti-pattern above
2. If detected, note the specific part of their answer that triggered it
3. Use the coaching language as a starting point but adapt to the persona's voice
4. Limit to 2 anti-patterns per feedback session — focus on the most impactful ones
5. Always pair anti-pattern feedback with a concrete suggestion for improvement
