# Interview Timing Guide

Pacing guidance for mock interviews. These are targets, not hard limits — but consistently exceeding them is a signal to coach on conciseness.

## Per-Question Timing

| Question Type | Answer Target | Answer Max | With Follow-ups Max |
|---------------|---------------|------------|---------------------|
| Behavioral | 2-3 min | 4 min | 7 min |
| Technical discussion | 3-5 min | 7 min | 10 min |
| Coding | 20-25 min | 30 min | 30 min |
| System design | 25-35 min | 40 min | 45 min |
| Situational | 2-3 min | 4 min | 6 min |
| Motivational | 1-2 min | 3 min | 4 min |

## Round-Level Timing

| Stage | Total Duration | Questions | Buffer for Transitions | Candidate Questions |
|-------|---------------|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|
| Phone Screen | 30 min | 3-4 | 3 min | 3-5 min |
| Technical | 45 min | 1-2 + discussion | 3 min | 2-3 min |
| Onsite Behavioral | 45 min | 4-5 | 3 min | 2-3 min |
| System Design | 45 min | 1 | Built in | 2-3 min |
| Bar Raiser | 60 min | 4-6 | 4 min | 3-5 min |

## Timing Signals During Mock

**When a candidate is on track:**
- Let them finish naturally
- Move to follow-up if time permits

**When a candidate is running long (>50% over target):**
- After they finish, note in the debrief that timing needs work
- Do NOT interrupt during the mock — that breaks the simulation

**When a candidate is too brief (<50% of target):**
- Ask a follow-up to draw out more detail
- Note in the debrief that they need more depth

## Debrief Timing Notes

In the debrief, include a timing section if any question was notably over or under:

> **Timing:** Q2 ran long (~6 min for a behavioral). In a real interview, this would have cost you time on later questions. Practice the 2-minute version of this story.
