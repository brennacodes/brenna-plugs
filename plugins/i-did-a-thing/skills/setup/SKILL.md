# Set Up i-did-a-thing

Configure the plugin so your accomplishments are tracked, searchable, and ready to fuel resumes, interviews, and blog posts.

## Steps

### 1. Check for Existing Configuration

Read `.claude/i-did-a-thing.local.md`. If it exists, tell the user:

> Found existing configuration. I'll walk you through updating it — your current settings will be shown as defaults.

### 2. Gather Storage Settings

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

**Where should your .things directory live?**
- `./things` (current project — good for project-specific logs)
- `~/.things` (home directory — single source of truth across projects)
- Custom path

Then ask:

**How do you want to manage git for your things?**
- `auto` — automatically commit and push after each log entry
- `ask` — ask me each time whether to commit/push
- `manual` — I'll handle git myself

### 3. Gather Git Remote Settings

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

**Do you want to sync your .things directory to a git remote?**
- Yes — I have a repo ready
- Yes — create one for me (I'll give you the details)
- No — local only for now

If yes, ask for:
- **Remote URL** (e.g., `git@github.com:username/my-things.git`)
- **Branch** (default: `main`)

### 4. Gather Professional Profile

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

**What's your current role/title?**
(Free text input)

**What are you targeting professionally?** (Select all that apply)
- Promotion to a specific role
- Lateral move to a new domain
- Building expertise in current role
- Career pivot
- Leadership/management track
- Individual contributor growth

Then ask as free text:
- **Target role(s)** — What role(s) are you working toward?
- **Key skills you're building** — Comma-separated list of skills you're actively developing
- **Skills you want to develop** — Comma-separated list of aspirational skills

### 5. Gather Preferences

Use AskUserQuestion to ask:

**Default tags for your logs?** (comma-separated, e.g., `engineering, python, leadership`)

**How detailed should interview follow-ups be?**
- `concise` — brief pointers, keep it moving
- `detailed` — thorough analysis with examples and suggestions
- `coaching` — full coaching mode with action items and follow-up questions

### 6. Initialize the .things Directory

Based on the chosen path, create the directory structure:

```
<things_path>/
├── .gitkeep
├── logs/           # Individual accomplishment logs
├── arsenal/        # Synthesized skill summaries (auto-generated)
├── targets/        # Professional goal tracking
└── index.md        # Auto-generated index of all logs
```

Run via Bash:
```bash
mkdir -p <things_path>/{logs,arsenal,targets}
touch <things_path>/.gitkeep
```

If git remote was configured, initialize git:
```bash
cd <things_path>
git init
git remote add origin <remote_url>
git checkout -b <branch>
```

### 7. Create the Index File

Write `<things_path>/index.md`:

```markdown
---
title: "My Things Index"
description: "Auto-generated index of accomplishments"
last_updated: <current_date>
total_entries: 0
---

# Things I've Done

This index is automatically maintained by the i-did-a-thing plugin.

## By Date

_No entries yet. Run `/i-did-a-thing:thing-i-did` to log your first accomplishment!_

## By Tag

_Tags will appear here as you log things._

## By Impact

_Impact levels will be summarized here._
```

### 8. Create Professional Targets File

Write `<things_path>/targets/profile.md`:

```markdown
---
current_role: "<role>"
target_roles:
  - "<target>"
career_direction:
  - "<direction>"
building_skills:
  - "<skill>"
aspirational_skills:
  - "<skill>"
last_updated: <current_date>
---

# Professional Profile

This file tracks your professional goals and is used by the interview-me
and construct-resume skills to give you targeted advice.

## Current Focus

<populated from user input>

## Gap Analysis

_This section is auto-updated as you log accomplishments and practice interviews._
```

### 9. Write Configuration

Write `.claude/i-did-a-thing.local.md`:

```yaml
---
things_path: "<chosen_path>"
git_remote: "<remote_url or none>"
git_branch: "<branch>"
git_workflow: "<auto|ask|manual>"
default_tags:
  - "<tag>"
interview_depth: "<concise|detailed|coaching>"
current_role: "<role>"
target_roles:
  - "<target>"
career_direction:
  - "<direction>"
building_skills:
  - "<skill>"
aspirational_skills:
  - "<skill>"
last_updated: <current_date>
---

# i-did-a-thing Configuration

Generated by `/i-did-a-thing:setup`. Run it again to reconfigure.

These settings are used by all i-did-a-thing skills:
- `thing-i-did` — log accomplishments
- `interview-me` — practice interview questions
- `construct-resume` — build tailored resumes

Use `/mark-my-words:from-things` to turn your logs into blog posts.
```

### 10. Confirm Setup

Tell the user:

> Your i-did-a-thing setup is complete!
>
> - Things directory: `<path>`
> - Git: `<remote status>`
> - Interview depth: `<depth>`
>
> **Quick start:**
> - `/i-did-a-thing:thing-i-did` — Log something you did
> - `/i-did-a-thing:interview-me` — Practice an interview question
> - `/i-did-a-thing:construct-resume` — Build a resume for a job listing
