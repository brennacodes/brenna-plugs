## Resume Bullet Writing Rules

1. **Start with a strong action verb**: Led, Built, Designed, Migrated, Reduced, Automated, Mentored, Architected, Delivered, Resolved
2. **Be specific about what**: Not "worked on the backend" but "redesigned the authentication pipeline"
3. **Include how**: The approach, tools, or skills used
4. **End with measurable impact**: Numbers, percentages, time saved, users affected
5. **Match the listing's language**: If they say "distributed systems," use "distributed systems," not "microservices" (unless both apply)

### Good Bullets (from logs)
- "Migrated authentication service from session-based to OAuth2, reducing login failures by 40% and enabling SSO across 3 internal applications"
- "Led cross-team effort to standardize API contracts, improving integration reliability from 94% to 99.7% uptime"
- "Mentored 2 junior engineers through their first production deployments, establishing a deployment checklist adopted team-wide"

### Weak Bullets (avoid)
- "Worked on authentication improvements"
- "Helped with API standardization"
- "Mentored junior team members"
